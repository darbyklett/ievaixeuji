                            <p> I saw this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/8ddq6s/sleep_cycle_app_finaly_introduced_apple_watch/?st=JGJAPSEGampsh=eeff963e) in this sun last week and have been using Sleep cycle on my AW3 since then. Generally pretty damn happy with it so far. But last night I had the alarm set for 5am. And it woke me up at 2:38 by the watch repeatedly tapping me on the wrist. Was in a sleep haze but pretty sure it said alarm on the screen. I know it’s meant to tap you if you are snori. Hi folks im doing a project for final year and was wondering if any of you used sleep cycle. If so i would like to ask a for your data, which will be handled and accepted anonymously. If you are interested to help please send me a private message, thank you in advance. Im in my final year of software engineering and am completing my final year project in preditive modeling. The data will only be used to create the model, and the project will only be marked at university with no intention Two days of sleep. Obviously on of them has more deep sleep and is more relaxed according to the chart, then the other. But for some reason thats when my sleep quality was 73%, and the other day when chart is more unstable - 92%. I just think this app is a huge BS. https://ibb.co/fibhvU https://ibb.co/dHnY29. 
I have no idea why sleeping too long seems to have a negative effect. I'm guessing that whatever chemicals your body is producing might add up and you have too much when you wake up. And because setting the alarm to the same time each day isn't going to work when I stay up late fall right back asleep after the alarm wakes me, I tend to set it roughly 9 hours and 30 minutes after I go to bed, and the Sleep Cycle Alarm app handles the rest. On falling right back asleep, one thing that has prove.

Hiya, I'm Mia, a 25 year old transgirl just short of graduating Comp.Sci. Looking for someone that likes to play all kinds of games, I love to play mechanically demanding and highly competitive games, but also like having something more relaxing as a side game. Something like League/Overwatch/Fighting Games/Racing Games and some Minecraft or FFXIV to calm down \^\^ Just hit me up with your Discord. We all know sleep is probably the most important nootropic, 7-8h is the guideline to hit. Given that, that implies ~16h of being awake before sleeping again with perhaps a nap somewhere halfway. What about when moving back a sleep cycle? 2 nights ago I was on a boatload of stimulants and was reading and learning until 6am, woke up at 2pm yesterday. I'm the kind of person where 7h of sleep has be drowsy all day and 8h has me high energy, 1hr literally makes or breaks me. Didn't So due to doing all nighters on my undergrad dissertation and using modafinil to help concentrate, recently my sleep cycle has become ridiculously out of whack. Currently I sleep from like 6 or 7am - 4pm, I’m basically nocturnal at this point. My problem is that I have an exam tomorrow at 9am until 12pm. What’s my best plan of attack do you think? A. Work through the night then do the exam. (I’m also crazy behind of revision) B. Work then try to get a couple hours sleep before waking Hey guys, newbie here on lazy keto (I still eat only low carb, high fat foods, but am not strictly counting macros). A thought occurred to me today that I didn't have an answer to. Does the "day" in "20g carbs per day" refer to every waking day from when you get up to when you go to bed or does it refer to every 24 hrs? The reason I ask is that yesterday, I ate pretty well (egg bites w/ bacon amp peasampcarrots, cheese covered chicken w/ broccoli amp mushrooms for both lunch amp dinner). 
I've worked on fixing my sleep for a while myself, and I've seen a few questions about this recently. So I figured I'd share. I'll break it down into 3 "parts" of advice that helped me, regarding the evening, sleep, and morning. Evening 1. Turn electronics off around 1-2 hours before you go to bed and read instead. If you must use electronics, lower the brightness a lot and install something like f.lux and set it to gradually turn to a "high" setting, meaning a lot more red light I'm not exaggerating. I get in bed between 12:00 and 1:00am every night. I'm never tired and you'll see why. Therefore I play on my phone and watch TV until 2-3. Then I attempt to sleep. I'm always overtired now or I can't fall asleep so I toss and turn until 4:00 am. I set my alarm at 8:00 am every day hoping by some miracle I get up and stay up. Instead, it goes off. For the next 2-3 hours, I'm constantly hitting my alarm and dozing off. I just don't want to get out of bed. I have cool dreams. Hey peeps, I've been trying to set sleep cycle alarm in my shortcuts and found out that it was actually a feature back when they were testing it out but they took it away. I asked them over here: https://twitter.com/yannbf/status/1123841765490987010 And they said they could work on bringing it back, and likely will be faster if people requested it as a wanted feature on their website: https://support.sleepcycle.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?mobile_site=true So. Can you guys help request I’ve lived in Arkansas my whole life except for a seasonal job in Michigan one summer. I graduated college a few years ago with a degree I’ll probably never use. I work at a 9-5 job now making /hour. I’m comfortable. However, I feel like I’m wasting my precious twenties/life working a job I hate. Living in a town I hate 30 minutes from where I lived until I was 18. I want out, I don’t want to do this and live this life because it’s “what I’m suppose to do.” I want to see the world or at least. I can't tell if my depression is getting worse because I am not sleeping well or if I am not sleeping well because my depression is getting worse. This last weekend was really busy for me and had my sleep schedule all over the place(sleeping 8 am - 5 pm then staying up all night type of thing). I hate having a bad sleep schedule but it is such an easy trap to fall into. Do you guys struggle with this? If so, how do you break out of this kind of cycle? Thanks, - Carter. My sleep cycle slipped into me being most awake at night for a while and I was only recently able to fix it. I usually got too exhausted and passed out due to energy issues so this took me ages as I couldn't just stay awake. Now I'm finally waking up at 8am but I get too tired around noon and passout for a few hours and often wake up being too tired to get up or do anything so I end up getting out of bed at 6 - 7pm. I really want to know how I can fix this as it's really frustrating and prevent. </p>
